Set-Up

Before you can tackle any software development task, you need to set up your development environment. You can think of your local development environment as a virtual workbench with all the tools necessary to work on your project. To set up your dev environment, follow these instructions:

Install python 3 to your system - any recent version of python 3 will work fine, though the most up-to-date version is advisable. If you need help with this step, check out this excellent guide from real python: https://realpython.com/installing-python/
 
Fork and clone the starter repo here: https://github.com/theforage/forage-jpmc-swe-task-1
IMPORTANT! Uncheck the “Copy the main branch only” box in the fork dialog on GitHub. A model answer has been provided in a separate branch from main.
if you are unfamiliar with forking, cloning, or git in general, take a look at the first two chapters of the git book here: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2
 
Open the project in your IDE of choice - if you don’t have a favourite python IDE yet, take a look at Pycharm Community Edition. It’s a well-designed IDE by Jetbrains packed with features and plugins, powerful enough to work on the most complex projects, and entirely free.
 
Create a new virtual environment in the project root. Pycharm can do this automatically for you using the “configure python interpreter” option in settings.
 
Install all project dependencies. These are listed in the requirements.txt file.

When you’re in a work environment, you’ll usually receive tasks in the form of engineering tickets. Here is an example of what this task looks like in the form of an engineering ticket

Purpose
We want to process the data feed of stock A and stock B’s price to enable us to analyse when trading for the stock should occur.

Acceptance Criteria

getDataPoint function should return correct tuple of stock name, bid_price, ask_price and price. Note: price of a stock = average of bid and ask
getRatio function should return the ratio of the two stock prices
main function should output correct stock info, prices and ratio

A Task 1 - Step-by-step Guide has been provided to walk you through completion of the task.
